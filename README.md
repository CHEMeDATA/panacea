# PANACEA

This reports the contributions of Mestrelab to the activity of the [PANACEA](https://panacea-nmr.eu/) project. PANACEA is a Europe-funded Pan-European solid-state NMR Infrastructure for access to high-performance instruments.

We attended [NMR conferences and PANACEA meetings](./conferences.md) to set the main goal of our developments:

- [Importing and exporting](./mnova-json.md) Mnova files in json format.
- [Creation of CHEMeDATA spectra, peaklist, assignement](./mnova-reader.md) from Mnova json files.
- Improving the [CHEMeDATA](https://chemedata.github.io/) platform to manage the new features for solid-state NMR.
- Creating CHEMeDATA spectra from [solid-states NMR CSA](nmr-csa.md) (chemical shift anisotropy) tensors.
- Creating CHEMeDATA [peak peak lists](./pealist.md) .
- Creating Mnova files from [CCCCSSSDDD FILES SPECTREA]() .
